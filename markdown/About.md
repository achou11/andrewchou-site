My name is Andrew. I'm a software engineer and web enthusiast. Software fosters my curiosity and I'm confident in its ability to build socially-driven technology.

I've focused most of my efforts on web development, primarily working in front-end. I'm also fascinated with geospatial and peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies and I would love to work in those domains some time in the future.

Programming languages and tech that I've worked with:

- Python
- JavaScript/HTML/CSS
- Node
- Go
- Rust
- bash
- SQL and relational databases
