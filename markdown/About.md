My name is Andrew. I like to call myself a software engineer (see home page), but I'm definitely still in the process of learning a bunch of things. It'll always be that way.

At the very heart of it, I'm a tech enthusiast. Software just happens to foster my curiosity, and I'm confident in its power to drive social good.

I've focused most of my efforts on web development, primarily working in front-end. I'm also fascinated with geospatial technologies and I would love to work in that domain some time in the future.

Programming languages and tech that I've worked with:

- Python
- JavaScript/HTML/CSS
- Go
- R
- Rust
- BASH
- SQL and relational databases
- NoSQL databases (Mongo is interesting but there are a ton of other cool solutions too)
