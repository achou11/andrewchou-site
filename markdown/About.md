My name is Andrew. I like to call myself a software developer, but I'm definitely still in the process of learning a bunch of things. It'll always be that way.

At the very heart of it, I'm a tech enthusiast. Software just happens to foster my curiosity, and I truly believe in its power to help people around the world.

I've focused most of my efforts on web development in recent months, primarily working in front-end, but having a strong desire to do back-end as well. I'm also fascinated with geospatial technologies, and I would love to work with spatial data and technologies some time in the future.

Languages and tech that I've worked with or have picqued my interest include:

- Python
- JavaScript/HTML/CSS
- Go
- Rust
- Elixir
- R
- SQL and relational databases (PostgreSQL and SQLite)
- NoSQL databases (Mongo is interesting but there are a ton of other cool solutions too)
