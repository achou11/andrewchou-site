## Some useful commands if you clone this repo:

- `npm install` --> install dependencies for project
- `npm start` --> use for development and watch for file changes
- `npm run build` --> generate optimized bundle
- `npm run dev-server` --> use `webpack-dev-server` to start a dev server (non-optimized bundle)
- `npm run prod-server` --> use `webpack-dev-server` to start a server that serves optimized bundle

## To-do list:
- Refactor the nav-scroll listener and add it to the `Nav` component
- CSS can always use some help
- Optimize my webpack configuration i.e. code-splitting and other relevant techniques (**NEED LOTS OF HELP WITH THIS**)
- Add some PWA features (**WOULD LOVE ANY GUIDANCE ON THIS**)
