# This is the source code for my soon-to-be personal site.

## Some useful commands if you clone this repo:

- `npm install` -> install dependencies for project
- `npm start` -> use for development and watch for file changes
- `npm build` -> generate optimized bundle
- `npm run dev-server` -> use `webpack-dev-server` to start a dev server (non-optimized bundle)
- `npm run prod-server` -> use `webpack-dev-server` to start a server that serves optimized bundle
